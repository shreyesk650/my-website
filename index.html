       </strong>


       <p>


       Basketball is a very fun sport to play, It requires a lot of practice and skill. 
       The goal of the game is to shoot the ball through the net. There are many ways to score. A layup 
       would be two points, a jump shot would be two points, and a three pointer is three points. There are four quarters and 
       each one is 12 minutes. There are five players on each team and 10 bench players. There is one coach that is there during
       the game. Basketball players are usually very tall. The height of a basketball hoop is 10 feet. Dunking is one of the hardest
       ways to score in a real basketball game. These are all the basics for learning basketball.
